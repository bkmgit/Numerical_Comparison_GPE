The code was built for Julia Versions later than 1.0 .

The following packages are needed:

IterativeSolvers
SparseArrays
LinearAlgebra
JLD



------------------ EXAMPLE -------------------------
Start Julia and change directory to Numerical_Comparison/GPE/2D/using IterativeSolvers/Optical_Lattice/, this is section 4.1 in the paper. 

Write include("Run.jl"). The files will be saved in the folder T1. 
Once a reference solution has been calculated, the error may be estimated using 
the code in "Error_Est_FEM.jl"
