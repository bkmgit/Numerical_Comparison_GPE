The code was built for Julia Versions later than 1.0 .

The following packages are needed:


SparseArrays
LinearAlgebra
JLD

FFTW			#For spectral method


------------------ EXAMPLE -------------------------
Start Julia and change directory to Numerical_Comparison/GPE/1D/Single_Soliton,
write include("Run.jl"). The code solves id_t u = -d_{xx}u-|u|^2u with initial value u0 = sqrt(2)exp(ix/2)sech(x). Which is section 3.1 in the paper. The files are saved in the folder T10. 

To calculate the errors simply run the command include("Error_Est_FEM.jl")
